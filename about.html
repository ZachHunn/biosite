        <p>The person I did my bio site on was my wife Jeanetta and, I could not think of a better person to use for
            this site. We met when I moved to Maryland for my final two years of high school. We began to date the last
            two days of our Senior year and, two years later we married. In these nine years, we have been blessed with
            three children our oldest son Zayden(7), our youngest son Zamir(5), and finally, our baby girl Zaria(9 mos).
            From the home page, you probably gathered that she works in the makeup industry. She is a beauty
            entrepreneur that goes by J'Victoria. When she was younger, she wanted to be a nurse just like her
            grandmother, so that she could help others, but she also had an inkling that she would want to do something
            with makeup in the future. During her pursuit of becoming a Registered Nurse, she realized that she wanted
            to be more creative with her hands. She became a makeup enthusiast and began practicing on herself weekly.
            She was hesitant about doing makeup on others because of the possibility of not having constant clientele
            due to being a military spouse. But through the encouragement of her family and friends, she decided to
            pursue a career as a makeup artist and now she is known as one of the best makeup artists in Tucson, AZ. Her
            dream does not stop there she wants her to take MakeByJ'Victoria and turn it into a Global Brand Name.</p>
